Attribute Information:

For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

While forming the final tidy data set, following variables and summaries were created:
filesinfolder - has list of files in zipped folderdata 
ActivityTest, dataActivityTrain, dataSubjectTest, dataSubjectTrain, dataFeaturesTest, dataFeaturesTrain - raw data 
dataSubject, dataActivity, dataFeatures - merged data for subject, activity, features 
dataFeaturesNames - has names of features 
dataMerged - has merged data 
setMeanStdNames - has names from 
dataFeaturesNames which are required 
dataMergedlater - has data for MeanStdNames variables from dataMerged 
dataMergedlater1 - has tidy data post calculating mean 
tidydata.txt - has the output

The final file has following attributes:
